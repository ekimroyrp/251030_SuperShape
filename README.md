# SuperShape Explorer

SuperShape Explorer is an interactive Three.js experience for studying Johan Gielis’ superformula in 3D. It renders a real-time parametric mesh with configurable controls so you can visualize a wide range of organic forms, morph between presets, and evaluate the mathematical structure behind supershapes.

## Features
- Real-time supershape mesh generated from Gielis’ superformula with adjustable latitude/longitude resolution
- Preset browser with smooth morph animations, auto-cycling playlist, and manual overrides
- Intuitive slider controls (powered by lil-gui) covering all key parameters, rotation, wireframe, and diagnostics
- Responsive Three.js scene with OrbitControls, cinematic lighting, and optional performance stats
- Production-ready Vite + TypeScript tooling with build and preview scripts
